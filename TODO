TODO:

Implement:

1. Analysis point placement
2. Analysis point properties
    - requires topographic slope
3. Saturation
    - requires rain timer and button or equiv test mechanism
4. Set surface as only physics chain/bedrock spearate chain is problematic
5. Trees and other local point modifiers (proximity modifier object class, usable for drains, trees, roads, etc.)
6. River object. Where the bedrock is at a local minimum, uses a shovel to dig soil to zero there and attaches a kill zone for physics bodies that reach the "river".
7. Display scale bars H and V
8. Balls back to soil after not moving for a certain time
9. Analysis point fade and reimposed upon changes to soil thickness
    - allow "sectoring" so only changed sectors are redotted
    - take a horizontally-averaged soil moisture z-profile through the changed sector and use it to repopulate redotted sectors
    

Fix:

1. Slide bodies not being converted to balls when within a short range of the right boundary


Sprite work:

1. button states
2. house less tall


DONE:

√ House and other "real object" sprites should scale with the physical coordinate system 
√ Balls not being killed when they accidentally cross into subsurface
