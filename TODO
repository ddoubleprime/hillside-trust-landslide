TODO:

Implement:

1. Analysis point placement
2. Analysis point properties
    - requires topographic slope
3. Saturation
    - requires rain timer and button or equiv test mechanism
5. Trees and other local point modifiers (proximity modifier object class, usable for drains, trees, roads, etc.)
    - proximity method returns all analysis points within a radius
    - scale effect by distance 
6. River object. Where the bedrock is at a local minimum, uses a shovel to dig soil to zero there and attaches a kill zone for physics bodies that reach the "river".
7. Display scale bars H and V
8. Balls back to soil after not moving for a certain time
9. Analysis point fade and reimposed upon changes to soil thickness
    - allow "sectoring" so only changed sectors are redotted
    - take a horizontally-averaged soil moisture z-profile through the changed sector and use it to repopulate redotted sectors
10. Disable dragging while in shovel or dump mode
11. Disallow digging of soil below bedrock surface by shovels?
12. Change thickness slider to a +/- soil everywhere button that adds a fixed increment per click    


Fix:

1. Slide bodies not being converted to balls when within a short range of the right boundary
2. Still a fair number of balls killed when running over sharply convex obstacles
    - can be fixed by killing when below lowest adjacent point, rather than interpolation between
3. Are killed bodies that exit L side removed properly from the balls array?


Sprite work:

1. button states
2. house less tall
3. house physics poly to match shape


DONE:

√ House and other "real object" sprites should scale with the physical coordinate system 
√ Balls not being killed when they accidentally cross into subsurface 
√ Set surface as only physics chain/bedrock separate chain is problematic
